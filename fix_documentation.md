# Mood Tracking and Dashboard Fixes

This document outlines the changes made to fix the errors in the GCSE web application, specifically focusing on the dashboard and mood tracking functionality.

## Summary of Changes

1. **Dashboard Improvements**
   - Fixed path references in navigation links
   - Added error checking for database query results
   - Updated task query to match actual database structure
   - Added check for mood_widget.php existence
   - Improved mobile responsiveness

2. **Mood Tracking Fixes**
   - Converted all PDO database code to mysqli for consistency
   - Updated AJAX endpoints to use mysqli
   - Fixed transaction handling
   - Improved error handling

## Technical Details

### Database Connection Consistency

The main issue identified was an inconsistency in database connection methods:
- The main application uses mysqli (in db_connect.php)
- The mood tracking feature was using PDO (in database.php)

This inconsistency was causing errors when the mood tracking feature tried to interact with the rest of the application.

### Files Modified

1. `/pages/dashboard.php`
   - Fixed path references (changed absolute paths to relative paths)
   - Added error checking for database query results
   - Updated task query to match actual database structure
   - Added check for mood_widget.php existence

2. `/pages/mood_tracking/includes/functions.php`
   - Converted all PDO code to mysqli
   - Updated transaction handling
   - Improved error handling

3. `/pages/mood_tracking/index.php`
   - Updated to work with mysqli implementation
   - Improved error handling

4. `/pages/mood_tracking/ajax/get_topics.php`
   - Converted from PDO to mysqli
   - Improved error handling

5. `/pages/mood_tracking/ajax/delete_entry.php`

   - Fixed transaction handling

6. `/pages/mood_tracking/ajax/get_recent_entries.php`

## Testing

All changes have been tested locally to ensure:
- The dashboard loads correctly
- Navigation links work properly
- Mood tracking functionality works as expected
- AJAX endpoints return correct data
- Error handling works properly

## Next Steps

After deploying these changes, it's recommended to:
1. Run the SQL script to create the mood tracking tables if not already done
2. Test all functionality on the live server
3. Consider implementing a consistent database connection method across the entire application
